Walkthrough of DNA Subway Red Line - Genome Annotation
------------------------------------------------------
Annotation adds features and information to a DNA sequence – such as genes and
their locations, structures, and functions. A good introduction to annotation
can be found in the paper `A beinner's guide to eukaryotic genome annotation
<https://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v13/n5/full/nrg3174.html>`_. Wel also
suggest the DNA Subway's primer on `annotation evidence <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/project/ngs/panel/1946#>`_.
This guide contains an explination of basic functions for this line, as well
as exercises that might be used in the classroom.

**Some things to remember about the platoform**

- On Red Line, you can annotate up to 150KB of your own DNA sequence
- We provide sample sequence for you to try, or you can upload your own

*Create and DNA Subway Red Line Annotation Project with Apollo*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  .. note::
       DNA Subway is transitioning away from the original Java-based Apollo software
       as most popular web browsers will no longer support Java. The new Apollo is
       Java-free.


  1. Log-in to `DNA Subway <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/>`_ - unregistered users may 'Enter as Guest'

  2. Click ‘Annotate a genomic sequence.’ (Red Square); select the 'Web Apollo' version

  3. For 'Select Organism type' choose 'Animal' or 'Plant' and then select
     the appropriate subtype.

     .. tip::
         The 'Select Organisim' step will load appropriate sample sequences and
         will also adjust the models used in the de novo gene finding process.

   4. For 'Select Sequence Source'

   5. (Optional) If you have a GFF file of annotated features, you may load these
      import these annotations from the Green Line, or from a custom GFF file.

   6. Name your project and organisim (required) and give a description if
      desired. Click 'Continue' to proceed.


**Example Exercise: Annotate Arabodopsis Genes**
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

  3. For 'Select Organism type' choose 'Plant' and then 'Dicotyledon.'

  4. from 'Select a sample sequence' chose 'Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) chr1, 75.00 kb'.

  5. Provide your project with a title, then Click ‘Continue.’
