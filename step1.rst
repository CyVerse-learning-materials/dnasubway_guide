DNA Subway is designed to be a classroom-freindly approach to bioinformatics.
Unlike most CyVerse platforms, you can even use Subway without registering for
a CyVerse account. We do encourage you to register however, only work from
registered users can be saved.

.. #### Comment: short description

**Some things to remember about the platoform**


- DNA Subway access must be requested through the CyVerse user portal. You can
  check if you already have access, or request access by logging into the portal
  and visiting the `My Services <https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine>`_ page.
  If DNA Subway is not listed, click on `Available <https://user.cyverse.org/services/available>`_
  services to request access.
- We suggest that every student using DNA Subway obtain their own account.
