DNA Subway Red Line - Create an Annotation Project with Apollo \u00b6 transition away from Java DNA Subway is transitioning away from the original Java-based Apollo software as most popular web browsers will no longer support Java. The new Apollo is Java-free. Log-in to DNA Subway - unregistered users may 'Enter as Guest' Click 'Annotate a genomic sequence.' (Red Square); select the 'Web Apollo' version For 'Select Organism type' choose 'Animal' or 'Plant' and then select the appropriate subtype. The 'Select Organism' step will load appropriate sample sequences and will also adjust the models used in the de novo gene finding process. For 'Select Sequence Source' select a sample sequence. Apollo support Currently, the Java-free Apollo version of Subway does not support upload of a custom DNA Sequence. This feature is coming soon, but we will help you upload custom genomes/regions for your use in the classroom (Optional) If you have a GFF file of annotated features, you may load these import these annotations from the Green Line, or from a custom GFF file. Name your project and organism (required) and give a description if desired. Click 'Continue' to proceed. Example Exercise - Project Creation: Arabidopsis ChrI \u00b6 In this and subsequent steps, we will annotate a 75KB section of Arabidopsis chromosome I. 1. Log-in to DNA Subway - unregistered users may 'Enter as Guest'. 2. Click 'Annotate a genomic sequence.' (Red Square); select the 'Web Apollo' version. 3. For 'Select Organism type' choose 'Plant' and then 'Dicotyledon'. 4. from 'Select a sample sequence' chose 'Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) chr1, 75.00 kb'. 5. Provide your project with a title, then Click 'Continue.' Sequence You can view your DNA sequence by clicking the 'Sequence' link in the 'Project Information' tab at the bottom of the page. DNA Subway Red Line - Find and Mask Repetitive DNA \u00b6 One you have created a Red Line Project, you may begin the process of generating and assembling predictions and evidence that can be used to annotate genes. 1. Click 'RepeatMasker' 2. When 'RepeatMasker' turns 'green' and the icon displays a 'V' (view); click 'RepeatMasker' again to view results. Example Exercise - Repeat Masking: Arabodopsis ChrI \u00b6 Example Sequence: Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) ChrI, 75 kb Tool(s): RepeatMasker Concept(s): Non-coding DNA, sequence repeats, mobile genetic elements (transposons) Following the RepeatMasking steps for the Arabidopsis ChrI sample above, answer the following discussion questions : How many hits were detected in your sample? RepeatMasker reports the length of the repetitive sequences (Length) as well as the class (Attributes). What is the average length of sequences identified as \"simple repeats\"? What is the average length of sequences identified as \"low complexity\"? What is the total percentage of repetitive DNA in your sequence? (Sum of the length of all repetitive sequence / sequence length (75 kb) Some Useful Definitions for Repetitive Sequences Simple repeats: 1-5bp repeats (e.g. repetitive dinucleotides 'AT' etc.) Low Complexity DNA: Poly-purine/ poly-pyrimidine stretches, or regions of extremely high AT or GC content. Processed Pseudogenes, SINES, Retrotranscripts: Non-functional RNAs present within genomic sequence. Transposons (DNA, Retroviral, LINES): Genetic elements which have the ability to be amplified and redistributed within a genome. Additional Investigation: In the results table under 'Attributes' each repeat sequence is labeled \"RepeatMasker#-XXX\" The '#' is the ordinal number of the hit, the XXX is the class of DNA element (e.g. \"Simple_repeat\" or \"Low_complexity\"). There are other types of repetitive elements such as transposons and pseudogenes (e.g. Helitron and COPIA) Use online resources to learn more: ( http://gydb.org/index.php/Main_Page ). DNA Subway Red Line - Making Gene Predictions \u00b6 De novo gene predictors can be run on a sample sequence to generate predictions of gene structure and location based solely on the sequence nucleotides. Click on one or more gene prediction tools under the 'Gene Prediction' stop. to view the results table, click the gene predictor again once the indicator displays 'V' (view). Example Exercise - Predict Genes: Arabidopsis ChrI \u00b6 Example Sequence: Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) ChrI, 75 kb Tool(s): Augustus, FGenesH, Snap, tRNA Scan Concept(s): Genomic DNA, Gene Structure, Canonical sequences Following the gene prediction steps for the Arabidopsis ChrI sample above, answer the following discussion questions : Look at the 'Type' column in the gene prediction report. Considering the Augustus results, find the 6 th gene prediction (hint: AUGUSTUS006;ID=g6) and then locate the first mention of the term 'gene' and copy down the gene's 'start' (i.e. the starting basepair). Note the number of times you see the term 'exon' (i.e. number of exons predicted). Gene Predictor Exon Start (bp) Exon Stop (bp) Augustus 23456 23684 Augustus Augustus Augustus Augustus Based on the chart, did all the gene predictors yield genes starting at the same location? Did all the gene predictions have the same number of exons? Looking at the number of results returned by tRNA Scan, why are they so different from results made by other predictors? Are their places in the genome where tRNAs are more or less densely concentrated? Additional Investigation: Look for the background link at the bottom of the DNA Subway home page and review the section entitled 'Gene Finding'. DNA Subway Red Line - Visualize predicted genes in a Genome Browser \u00b6 A genome browser is an essential tool for visualization genomic data in context. The integrated JBrowse genome browser will allow you to see the visualized gene predictions generated so far. Click 'JBrowse' and allow browser to load. Zoom into a region (for example, paste the region 1:3740638..3749063 into the location window. Tip JBrowse will load multiple tracks of data. Since the entire genome is loaded, we recommend using the 'highlight a region' feature to help keep your place. You may also wish to record the coordinates you are viewing as shown in the coordinates window. You may also adjust the settings for a particular track by clicking on the track name. Right-click on any gene to view additional details about that gene. Examine gene details by double-clicking on a gene to select; then right-click to open the 'View Details' menu. To view more tracks, click on 'Full-Screen View' in the upper-left of the JBrowse window to see any additional tracks available. Useful Definitions Genome Browser: A GUI (Graphical User Interface) for viewing biological information. GBrowse (DNA Subway's Browser) is \"designed to view genomes. It displays a graphical representation of a section of a genome, and shows the positions of genes and other functional elements. It can be configured to show both qualitative data such as the splicing structure of a gene, and quantitative data such as microarray expression levels.\" [citation] Track: The individual regions of the display where information imported into the browser. For each type (or source) of information, there is usually an associated track. Example Exercise - Visualize predicted genes: Arabidopsis ChrI \u00b6 Example Sequence: Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) ChrI, 75 kb Tool(s): Local Browser (JBrowse) Concept(s): Gene orientation/structure, transposons, chromosome organization Following the gene browser steps for the Arabidopsis ChrI sample above, answer the following discussion questions (the locations of the genes are given in parentheses and can be pasted into the browser): Considering the following genes: - BFN1-201 (1:3748591..3753070) - SCAMP5-201 (1:3744556..3749035) - STP1-201 (1:3776366..3780845) - At1G11270.2 (1:3780041..3789000) Do all the gene predictors agree with each other? Which gene predictions seem to match the Ensemble genes most closely? DNA Subway Red Line - Search Databases using BLAST \u00b6 DNA Subway searches customized versions of UniGene and UniProt that contain only validated plant proteins, and are free of predicted or hypothetical proteins. Click 'BLASTN'; wait until the flashing icon displays 'V' (view) Click 'BLASTN' again to view the results. Click 'BLASTX'; wait until the flashing icon displays 'V' (view). Click 'BLASTX' again to view the results. Click on 'JBrowse' and then click 'Full-screen View' in the upper-left. In the 'Available Tracks' menu, add the Blastn and Blastx tracks. Useful Definitions **Some Useful Definitions** BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is an algorithm that search databases of biological sequence information (e.g. DNA, RNA, or Protein sequence) and return matches. The BLASTN program is specific to nucleotide data, and the BLASTX algorithm works with sequence data translated into amino acid sequences. UniGene: A database of transcript data, \"each UniGene entry is a set of transcript sequences that appear to come from the same transcription locus (gene or expressed pseudogene), together with information on protein similarities, gene expression, cDNA clone reagents, and genomic location.\" [citation] cDNA: DNA produced by reverse transcribing mRNA using reverse transcriptase. cDNAs are used to investigate mRNA within a biological sample. ESTs: \"Small pieces of DNA sequence (usually 200 to 500 nucleotides long) that are generated by sequencing either one or both ends of an expressed gene. The idea is to sequence bits of DNA that represent genes expressed in certain cells, tissues, or organs from different organisms.\" [citation] Example Exercise - Search Databases using BLAST: Arabidopsis ChrI \u00b6 Example Sequence: Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) ChrI, 75 kb Tool(s): BLASTN, BLASTX, Upload Data Concept(s): RNA, cDNAs, ESTs, Biological Databases Following the BLAST steps for the Arabidopsis ChrI sample above, answer the following discussion questions (the locations of the genes are given in parentheses and can be pasted into the browser): Both BLASTN and BLASTX returns the 'Length' of your resulting matches. Do you notice differences in the average lengths of BLASTN and BLASTX matches? Explain. Under 'Type' both BLASTN and BLASTX returns 'match' and 'match_part.' 'Match' is describing the overall length of a single match, but individual significant matches may be fragmented, i.e. 'match_part.' Do BLASTN and BLASTX return 'match' and 'match_part' results in different frequencies? Explain. DNA Subway Red Line - Build Gene Models using Apollo \u00b6 Apollo is an extension of JBrowse which allows the user to build and edit gene models. Apollo has a number of features but in this tutorial, we will give brief intro covering the conceptual steps. A. Import Blastn model to match for transcript length Blast searches are matched against UniGene(blastn) and UniProt(blasts). UniGen models are derived from cDNA and ESTs (transcriptome evidence) produced by experiment. Open Apollo and zoom into a region of interest (e.g. 1:3793981..3802033 ) Ensure at least the following tracks are selected (on): Augustus (and other gene predictors: FGenesH, SNAP, etc.) Blastn Double-click on the Blastn result, and drag this transcript into the yellow 'User-created Annotations' section. {width=\"400px\" height=\"250px\"} B. Select a scaffold model Use transcriptome evidence (UniGene - BLASTN) to select the best possible gene model for a scaffold. If no gene model exists or significantly reflects the UniGene model, use the UniGene model itself as a scaffold. Drag a plausible model into the yellow 'User-created Annotations' - in this case we will choose the Augustus model; double-click the Augustus model to select the entire model and drag into 'User-created Annotations'. Adjust the Augustus model to match the 5' and 3' configuration of the blastn model Delete the extraneous 5' exon (single-click to select; right-click to delete) Adjust the new 5' end to match the length of the blastn-derived transcript Adjust the 3' end of the Augustus-derived model (single-click to select; use your cursor/mouse to adjust the model length) C. Edit model for splice sites and variants Protein and EST data can be used to examine possible alternative transcripts. Proteins give clues to the actual length of the translated protein at that locus and its reading frame. Like full length cDNAs, ESTs give valuable information on transcript diversity. ESTs are generated by high throughput methods, and although the data may be fragmentary, it may capture biologically relevant information about splice variants. Turn on the blastx track Examine the additional evidence to consider making adjustments to your Augustus-derived model. If you wish to make additional isoforms of your gene: Double-click to select the entire Augustus-derived model Right-click on the model to duplicate Make adjustments to the model as desired You also have the option of adding additional EST evidence . For the Arabodopsis 75KB section, we have prepared a selection of EST data. You will need to close Apollo to load this data . Download the Arabidopsis ESTs for this region to your computer from this link Click on 'Upload Data'; under \"Add DNA data in FASTA format\" upload the EST file from the link in step 1. Click on 'User BLASTN' to align the ESTs to this section of the Arabidopsis genome Open 'Web Apollo'. The \"Blastn User\" track should be loaded. You may move this track to a convenient position on the browser While EST evidence is always incomplete, these sequences can help you determine features of the gene model. Learn More about Gene Evidence J.Craig Venter on ESTs \"Dynamic Gene\" Evidence animation (requires Flash) D. Determine translation start/stop sites After making your adjustments, you can confirm that your gene model(s) represents the longest possible transcripts: Double-click the model; right-click and select 'Set longest ORF' E. Compare gene model(s) with existing annotations After making your gene models you can compare them with existing annotations by turning on the 'Ensemble genes' track. In this case, our work confirms the first gene model made, but a potential isoform supported by blastx data is likely incorrect. Example Exercise - Build Gene Models using Apollo: Arabodopsis ChrI \u00b6 Example Sequence: Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) ChrI, 75 kb Tool(s): Apollo Concept(s): Synthesizing multiple lines of evidence Following the Apollo steps for the Arabidopsis ChrI sample above, answer the following discussion questions (the locations of the genes are given in parentheses and can be pasted into the browser): Try annotation of the following genes and take notes on your annotation ( right-click on the gene model, open the 'Information Editor' and scroll down to the comments section to enter comments).

Import Blastn model to match for transcript length Blast searches are matched against UniGene(blastn) and UniProt(blasts). UniGen models are derived from cDNA and ESTs (transcriptome evidence) produced by experiment. Open Apollo and zoom into a region of interest (e.g. 1:3793981..3802033 ) Ensure at least the following tracks are selected (on): Augustus (and other gene predictors: FGenesH, SNAP, etc.) Blastn Double-click on the Blastn result, and drag this transcript into the yellow 'User-created Annotations' section. {width=\"400px\" height=\"250px\"} B. Select a scaffold model Use transcriptome evidence (UniGene - BLASTN) to select the best possible gene model for a scaffold. If no gene model exists or significantly reflects the UniGene model, use the UniGene model itself as a scaffold. Drag a plausible model into the yellow 'User-created Annotations' - in this case we will choose the Augustus model; double-click the Augustus model to select the entire model and drag into 'User-created Annotations'. Adjust the Augustus model to match the 5' and 3' configuration of the blastn model Delete the extraneous 5' exon (single-click to select; right-click to delete) Adjust the new 5' end to match the length of the blastn-derived transcript Adjust the 3' end of the Augustus-derived model (single-click to select; use your cursor/mouse to adjust the model length) C. Edit model for splice sites and variants Protein and EST data can be used to examine possible alternative transcripts. Proteins give clues to the actual length of the translated protein at that locus and its reading frame. Like full length cDNAs, ESTs give valuable information on transcript diversity. ESTs are generated by high throughput methods, and although the data may be fragmentary, it may capture biologically relevant information about splice variants.

Even on a typical laptop, Kallisto can quantify 30 million reads in less than 3 minutes. Integrated into CyVerse, you can take advantage of CyVerse DNA Subway to process your reads, do the Kallisto quantification, and analyze reads with the Kallisto companion software in an R-Shiny app. Some things to remember about the platform You must be a registered CyVerse user to use Green Line. The Green Line was designed to make RNA-Seq data analysis \"simple\". However, we ask that users thoughtfully decide what \"jobs\" they want to submit. Each user is limited to a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs running on Green Line . A single Green Line project may take a week to process since HPC computing is subject to queues which hundreds of other jobs may be staging for. Additionally these systems undergo regular maintenance and are subject to periodic disruption. Note New, faster Green Line Green Line is now running on Jestream Cloud . This should greatly reduce queue times (The entire running time for this tutorial is about 60 minutes). We have designed Green Line for a lower number of concurrent users (<50), and still recommend teaching using jobs you have made public, and only running the entire workflow when you are working with novel data. Please let us know about your experience: send feedback . Important: Discontinued Support for Tuxedo Workflow The Tuxedo workflow previously implemented for the Green Line will has been removed in June 2019 . Data and previously analyzed results will still be available on the CyVerse Data Store, however it is not possible to execute new analyses which include Tuxuedo. Sample Data How to use provided sample data In this guide, we will use an RNA-Seq dataset ( \"Zika infected hNPCs\" ). This experiment compared human neuroprogenetor cells (hNPCs) infected with the Zika virus to non-infected hNPCs. You can read more about the experimental conditions and methods in this reference .

Please send feedback to DNALC Admin . The Purple Line provides the capability for analysis of microbiome and eDNA (environmental DNA) by implementing a simplified version of the QIIME 2 (pronounced \"chime two\") workflow. Using the Purple Line, you can analyze uploaded high throughput sequencing reads to identify species in microbial or environmental DNA samples. Metabarcoding uses high-throughput sequencing to analyze hundreds of thousands of DNA barcodes from complex mixtures of DNA. In a typical experiment, DNA is isolated from sterile swabs or material taken from different environmental locations or conditions. PCR is used to amplify a variable region, such as COI, or 12S or 16S ribosomal RNA genes, and sequence reads identify the variety and abundance of species from different samples. The analysis requires specialized software, such as QIIME 2. The Purple Line integrates sequence data and metadata imported from CyVerse's Data Store, demultiplexing of samples, quality control, and taxonomic identification and quantitation. Once sequences are analyzed, the results can be visualized to allow comparisons between samples and different conditions summarized in the metadata. Some things to remember about the platform You must be a registered CyVerse user to use Purple Line (register for a CyVerse account at user.cyverse.org). The Purple line was designed to make microbiome/eDNA data analysis \"simple\". However, we ask that users very carefully and thoughtfully decide what \"jobs\" they want to submit. A single Purple Line project may take hours to process since HPC computing is subject to queues which may support hundreds of other jobs. These systems also undergo regular maintenance and are subject to periodic disruption. DNA Subway implements the QIIME 2 software. This software is in continual development. Our version may not be the most current, and our documentation and explanation is not meant to replace the full QIIME 2 documentation . We have made design decisions to create a straightforward classroom-friendly workflow. While this Subway Line does not have all possible features of QIIME 2, we purpose to cover important concepts behind microbiome and eDNA analysis. Sample Data: How to use provided sample data In this guide, we will use a microbiome dataset ( \"ubiome-test-data\" ) collected from various water sources in Montana (down-sampled and de-identified).Where appropriate, a note (in this orange colored background) in the instructions will indicate which options to select to make use of this provided dataset. DNA Subway Purple Line - Metadata file and Sequencing Prerequisites \u00b6 If you are generating data for a project (i.e. sequencing samples), you will need to provide the sequencing data (fastq files) as well as a metadata file that describes the data contained in these sequencing files. This metadata must conform to strict guidelines, or analyses will fail. QIIME 2 metadata is stored in a TSV (tab-separated values) file. These files typically have a .tsv or .txt file extension, though it doesn't matter to QIIME 2 what file extension is used. TSV files are simple text files used to store tabular data, and the format is supported by many types of software, such as editing, importing, and exporting from spreadsheet programs and databases. Thus, it's usually straightforward to manipulate QIIME 2 metadata using the software of your choosing. If in doubt, we recommend using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to edit and export your metadata files. Handling Project Metadata Before you create your project, you will have generated metadata (as described above) for your project. You have two options for preparing this metadata to ensure that it conforms to the required QIIME2 parameters. The file must be validated (which you can do on your own or using Subway). If there are errors in your file (this is common), they must be fixed. Formatting Your Metadata Leading and trailing whitespace characters If any cell in the metadata contains leading or trailing whitespace characters (e.g. spaces, tabs), those characters will be ignored when the file is loaded. Thus, leading and trailing whitespace characters are not significant, so cells containing the values 'gut' and ' gut' are equivalent. This rule is applied before any other rules described below ID column The first column MUST be the ID column name (i.e. ID header) and the first line of this column should be #SampleID or one of a few alternative. - Case-insensitive: id; sampleid; sample id; sample-id; featureid; feature id; feature-id. - Case-sensitive: #SampleID; #Sample ID; #OTUID; #OTU ID; sample_name Sample IDs For the sample IDs, there are some simple rules to comply with QIIME 2 requirements: IDs may consist of any Unicode characters, with the exception that IDs must not start with the pound sign (#), as those rows would be interpreted as comments and ignored. IDs cannot be empty (i.e. they must consist of at least one character). IDs must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates). At least one ID must be present in the file. IDs cannot use any of the reserved ID column names (the sample ID names, above). The ID column can optionally be followed by additional columns defining metadata associated with each sample or feature ID. Metadata files are not required to have additional metadata columns, so a file containing only an ID column is a valid QIIME 2 metadata file. Column names May consist of any Unicode characters. Cannot be empty (i.e. column names must consist of at least one character). Must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates). Column names cannot use any of the reserved ID column names. Column values May consist of any Unicode characters. Empty cells represent missing data. Note that cells consisting solely of whitespace characters are also interpreted as missing data. QIIME 2 currently supports categorical and numeric metadata columns. By default, QIIME 2 will attempt to infer the type of each metadata column: if the column consists only of numbers or missing data, the column is inferred to be numeric. Otherwise, if the column contains any non-numeric values, the column is inferred to be categorical. Missing data (i.e. empty cells) are supported in categorical columns as well as numeric columns. For more details, and for how to define the nature of the data when needed, see the QIIME 2 metadata documentation . Working with an existing metadata file Tip If you have your own metadata file, it will still need to be validated once uploaded to DNA Subway. Using a spreadsheet editor, create a metadata sheet that provides descriptions of the sequencing files used in your experiment. Export this file as a tab-delimited .txt or .tsv file. following the QIIME 2 metadata documentation]( https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/tutorials/metadata/ ) recommendations. (Optional: if you using your own metadata file you can validate it using DNA Subway and or online QIIME2 validator Keemei ). Tip See an example metadata file used for our sample data here: metadata file . Click the Download button on the linked page to download and examine the file. ( Note : This is an Excel version of the metadata file, you must save Excel files as .TSV (tab-separated) to be compatible with the QIIME 2 workflow.)

Click +Add from CyVerse to add the FASTQ files uploaded to the CyVerse Data Store. Select your files and then click Add selected files {.interpreted-text role=\"guilabel\"} or Add all FASTQ files in this directory {.interpreted-text role=\"guilabel\"} as appropriate. Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: Navigate to: Shared Data > SEPA_microbiome_2016 > ubiome-test-data and click Add all FASTQ files in this directory 2. To add your metadata file you may use one of three options: - Add from CyVerse : Add a metadata file you have uploaded to CyVerse Data store - Upload locally : Directly upload a metadata file from your local computer - Create New : Create a new metadata file using DNA Subway Creating a metadata file using DNA Subway You can create a metadata file using DNA Subway. Creating the file step-by-step will help you to avoid metadata errors. Be sure you have consulted the QIIME 2 documentation so you can anticipate what the required fields are. To use this feature under in the 'Manage data' step under 'Metadata Files' click Create new Sample IDs and adding/removing samples These are unique IDs for each of your samples. All metadata files must have a column called #SampleID . Click +Add samples to add additional rows. In the Subway form, these will be unique, arbitrary names (roughly corresponding to well-positions on a 96-well microplate). You can change these (including pasting in sample names from an existing spreadsheet). Right-clicking on a row number allows you to remove or insert rows. Adding columns, managing sample descriptions and data types The very last column must be a sample description. You can click the arrow on the right of this column to add a new column (which will be added to the left). Column names must be unique, must not be empty, cannot contain whitespace, can contain a maximum of 32 characters, cannot match a reserved column name. Notice that when you click on a column name it is colored -pink for columns that have numeric data (e.g. measurements) and cyan for everything else (e.g. categorical descriptions in the form of words (i.e. strings)). Clicking a column name will allow you to change its type. Handling errors If you violate one of the rules for metadata formatting, the entry will turn red. Consult the help and or the QIIME 2 documentation to correct the error. Click Save to save your metadata file, and close the window. Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: Click Add from CyVerse Navigate to: Shared Data > SEPA_microbiome_2016 > ubiome-test-data Select the mappingfile_MT_corrected.tsv and then click Add selected files . 3. As needed, you can edit or rename your metadata file. Before proceeding, you must validate your metadata file. To validate, click the \"validate\" link to the right of the metadata file you wish to check. Once the validation completed, click Run to proceed. If you have errors, you will be presented with an Edit button so that you can return to the file and edit. B. Demultiplex reads At this step, reads will be grouped according to the sample metadata. This includes separating reads according to their index sequences if this was not done prior to running the Purple Line. For demultiplexing based on index sequences, the index sequences must be defined in the metadata file. Note Even if your files were previously demultimplexed (as will generally be the case with Illumina data) you must still complete this step to have your sequence read files appropriately associated with metadata. 1. Click the 'Demultiplex reads' and choose a number of reads to sample. When the job has completed click Demultiplexing Summary to view your results. In 'Random sequences to sample for QC', enter a value (1000 is recommended), Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: Use the default of 1000 sequences 2. When demultiplexing is complete, you will generate a file (.qzv) click this link to view a visualization and statistics on the sequence and metadata for this project. Tip Several jobs on Purple Line will take several minutes to an hour to complete. Each time you launch one of these steps you will get a Job ID. You can click the View job info {.interpreted-text role=\"guilabel\"} button to see a detailed status and diagnostic/error messages. If needed There is a [stop this job]{.title-ref} link at the bottom of the info page to cancel a job. Note QIIME2 Visualizations One of the features of QIIME 2 are the variety of visualizations provided at several analysis steps. Although this guide will not cover every feature of every visualization, here are some important points to note. QIIME2 View : DNA Subway uses the QIIME 2 View plugin to display visualizations. Like the standalone QIIME 2 software, you can navigate menus, and interact with several visualizations. Importantly, many files and visualizations can be directly download for your use outside of DNA Subway, including in report generation, or in your custom QIIME 2 analyses. You can view downloaded .qza or .qzv files at view.qiime2.org . Quality Graphs Explained After demultiplexing, you will be presented with a visualization that displays the following tables and graphs: Overview Tab Demultiplexed sequence counts summary : For each of the fastq files (each of which may generally correspond to a single sample), you are presented with comparative statistics on the number of sequences present. This is followed by a histogram that plots number of sequences by the number of samples. Per-sample sequence counts : These are the actual counts of sequences per sample as indicated by the sample names you provided in your metadata sheet. Interactive Quality Plot This is an interactive plot that gives you an average quality (y-axis) by the position along the read (x-axis). This box plot is derived from a random sampling of a subset of sequences. The number of sequences sampled will be indicated in the plot caption. You can use your mouse drag and zoom in to regions on the plot. Double-click your mouse to zoom out. 3. Click the \"Interactive Quality Plot\" tab to view a histogram of sequence quality. Use this plot at the tip below to determine a location to trim. Tips on trimming for sequence quality On the Interactive Quality Plot you are shown an histogram, plotting the average quality (x axis) Phred score vs. the position on the read (y axis) in base pairs for a subsample of reads. Zooming to determine 3' trim location Click and drag your mouse around a collection of base pair positions you wish to examine. Clicking on a given histogram bar will also generate a text report and metrics in the table below the chart. Using these metrics, you can choose a position to trim on the right side (e.g. 3' end of the sequence read). The 5' (left trim) is specific to your choice of primers and sequencing adaptors (e.g. the sum of the adaptor sequence you expect to be attached to the 5' end of the read). Poor quality metrics will generate a table colored in red, and those base positions will also be colored red in the histogram. Double-clicking will return the histogram to its original level of zoom. Example plots It is important to maximize the length of the reads while minimizing the use of low quality base calls. To this end, a good guideline is to trim the right end of reads to a length where the 25 th percentile is at a quality score of 25 or more. However, the length of trimming will depend on the quality of the sequence, so you may have to use a lower quality threshold to retain enough sequence for informative sequence searches and alignments. This may require multiple runs of the analysis to find the optimal trim length for your data. Quality drops significantly at base 35 Improved quality sequence C. Use DADA2 for Trimming and Error-correction of Reads It is important to only work with high quality data. This step will generate a sequence quality histogram which can be used to determine parameter for trimming. Click 'DADA2' and choose the metadata file corresponding to the samples you wish to analyze. Then choose values for trimming of the reads. For \"trimLeft\" (the position starting from the left you wish to trim) and \"TruncLen\" (this is the position where reads should be trimmed, truncating the 3' end of the read. Reads shorter than this length will be discarded). Finally, click Trim reads . Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: Based on the histogram for our sample, we recommend the following parameters: trimLeft: 17 (this is specific to primers and adaptors in this experiment) TruncLen: 200 (this is where low quality sequence begins, in this case because our sequence length is lower than the expected read length) D. Check Results of Trimming Once trimming is complete, the following outputs are expected: Click on DADA2 and then click on the links in the Results table to examine results. Trim Table ( Metric summary , Frequency per sample , Frequency per feature ): Summarizes the dataset post-trimming including the number of samples and the number of features per sample. The \"Interactive Sample Detail\" tab contains a sampling depth tool that will be used in computation of the core matrix. Note You will use the maximum frequency value for the Alpha rarefaction step So you may wish to record this value now for the DNA Subway 'Clustering sequences' step. Stats : Sequencing statistics for each of the sample IDs described in the original metadata file. Representative Sequences ( Sequence Length Statistics , Seven-Number Summary of Sequence Lengths , Sequence Table ): This table contains a listing of features observed in the sequence data, as well as the DNA sequence that defines a feature. Clicking on the DNA sequence will submit that sequence for BLAST at NCBI in a separate browser tab. The feature table contains two columns output by DADA2. DADA2 (Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2) determines what sequences are in the samples. DADA2 filters the sequences and identifies probable amplification or sequencing errors, filters out chimeric reads, and can pair forward and reverse reads to create the best representation of the sequences actually found in the samples and eliminating erroneous sequences. Feature ID : A unique identifier for sequences. Sequence : A DNA Sequence associated with each identifier. Clicking on any given sequence will initiate at BLAST search on the NCBI website. Click \"View report\" on the BLAST search that opens in a new web browser tab to obtain your results. Keep in mind that if your sequences are short (due to read length or trimming) many BLAST searches may not return significant results. Tip Although the term \"feature\" can (unfortunately) have many meanings as used by the QIIME2 documentation, unless otherwise noted in this documentation it can be thought of as an OTU ( Operational Taxonomic Unit ); another substitution for the word species. OTU is a convenient and common terminology for referring to an unclassified or undetermined species. Ultimately, we are attempting to identify an organism from a sample of DNA which may not be informative enough to reach a definitive conclusion. Tip If you want to redo the DADA2 step with different parameters, click the \"New Job\" tab on the upper left of a DADA2 window to submit a new job. New jobs appear as tabs on Subway steps that are typically run several times. You can go back an see these jobs which are labeled with a job number. DNA Subway Purple Line - Alpha Rarefaction/Clustering Sequences \u00b6 A. Alpha rarefaction At this step, you can visualize summaries of the data. A feature table will generate summary statistics, including how many sequences are associated with each sample. Click on 'Alpha rarefaction'. Select \"run\" and designate the minimum and maximum rarefaction depth. A minimum value should be set at 1. The maximum value is specific to your data set. The maximum value is specific to your data set. To determine what the maximum value should be set to, open the \"Trim Table\" from the \"DADA2\" step. You may not choose a value that is greater than the maximum frequency per sample. In general, choosing a value that is somewhere around the median frequency seems to work well, but you may want to increase that value if the lines in the resulting rarefaction plot don't appear to be leveling out, or decrease that value if you seem to be losing many of your samples due to low total frequencies closer to the minimum sampling depth than the maximum sampling depth. Identify the maximum Sequence Count value and enter that number as the maximum value. Click Submit Job . Note Since you may want to try Alpha rarefaction using different combinations of results from DADA2 trimming and your choice of rarefaction depths, your trim (DADA2) jobs are displayed on the left, and each new Alpha rarefaction setting will appear as a tab on the top.

Choose an appropriate classifier (see comments in the tip below) and click Submit job . Choosing Core metrics parameters Sampling Depth In downstream steps, you will need to choose a sampling depth for your sample comparisons. You can choose by examining the table generated at the Trim reads step. In the Trim Table output, Interactive Sample Detail tab, use the \"Sampling depth\" tool to explore how many sequences can be sampled during the Core matrix computation. As you slide the bar to the right, more sequences are sampled, but samples that do not have this many sequences will be removed during analysis. The sampling depth affects the number of sequences that will be analyzed for taxonomy in later steps: as the sampling depth increases, a greater representation of the sequences will be analyzed. However, high sampling depth could exclude important samples, so a balance between depth and retaining samples in the analysis must be found. Classifier Choose a classifier pertaining to your experiment type.

Please send feedback to DNALC Admin . The Purple Line provides the capability for analysis of microbiome and eDNA (environmental DNA) by implementing a simplified version of the QIIME 2 (pronounced \"chime two\") workflow. Using the Purple Line, you can analyze uploaded high throughput sequencing reads to identify species in microbial or environmental DNA samples. Metabarcoding uses high-throughput sequencing to analyze hundreds of thousands of DNA barcodes from complex mixtures of DNA. In a typical experiment, DNA is isolated from sterile swabs or material taken from different environmental locations or conditions. PCR is used to amplify a variable region, such as COI, or 12S or 16S ribosomal RNA genes, and sequence reads identify the variety and abundance of species from different samples. The analysis requires specialized software, such as QIIME 2. The Purple Line integrates sequence data and metadata imported from CyVerse's Data Store, demultiplexing of samples, quality control, and taxonomic identification and quantitation. Once sequences are analyzed, the results can be visualized to allow comparisons between samples and different conditions summarized in the metadata. Some things to remember about the platform You must be a registered CyVerse user to use Purple Line (register for a CyVerse account at user.cyverse.org). The Purple line was designed to make microbiome/eDNA data analysis \"simple\". However, we ask that users very carefully and thoughtfully decide what \"jobs\" they want to submit. A single Purple Line project may take hours to process since HPC computing is subject to queues which may support hundreds of other jobs. These systems also undergo regular maintenance and are subject to periodic disruption. DNA Subway implements the QIIME 2 software. This software is in continual development. Our version may not be the most current, and our documentation and explanation is not meant to replace the full QIIME 2 documentation . We have made design decisions to create a straightforward classroom-friendly workflow. While this Subway Line does not have all possible features of QIIME 2, we purpose to cover important concepts behind microbiome and eDNA analysis. Sample Data: How to use provided sample data In this guide, we will use a microbiome dataset ( \"ubiome-test-data\" ) collected from various water sources in Montana (down-sampled and de-identified).Where appropriate, a note (in this orange colored background) in the instructions will indicate which options to select to make use of this provided dataset.","title":"Walkthrough of DNA Subway Purple Line (beta testing documentation)"},{"location":"step8/#dna-subway-purple-line-metadata-file-and-sequencing-prerequisites","text":"If you are generating data for a project (i.e. sequencing samples), you will need to provide the sequencing data (fastq files) as well as a metadata file that describes the data contained in these sequencing files. This metadata must conform to strict guidelines, or analyses will fail. QIIME 2 metadata is stored in a TSV (tab-separated values) file. These files typically have a .tsv or .txt file extension, though it doesn't matter to QIIME 2 what file extension is used. TSV files are simple text files used to store tabular data, and the format is supported by many types of software, such as editing, importing, and exporting from spreadsheet programs and databases. Thus, it's usually straightforward to manipulate QIIME 2 metadata using the software of your choosing. If in doubt, we recommend using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to edit and export your metadata files. Handling Project Metadata Before you create your project, you will have generated metadata (as described above) for your project. You have two options for preparing this metadata to ensure that it conforms to the required QIIME2 parameters. The file must be validated (which you can do on your own or using Subway). If there are errors in your file (this is common), they must be fixed. Formatting Your Metadata Leading and trailing whitespace characters If any cell in the metadata contains leading or trailing whitespace characters (e.g. spaces, tabs), those characters will be ignored when the file is loaded. Thus, leading and trailing whitespace characters are not significant, so cells containing the values 'gut' and ' gut' are equivalent. This rule is applied before any other rules described below ID column The first column MUST be the ID column name (i.e. ID header) and the first line of this column should be #SampleID or one of a few alternative. - Case-insensitive: id; sampleid; sample id; sample-id; featureid; feature id; feature-id. - Case-sensitive: #SampleID; #Sample ID; #OTUID; #OTU ID; sample_name Sample IDs For the sample IDs, there are some simple rules to comply with QIIME 2 requirements: IDs may consist of any Unicode characters, with the exception that IDs must not start with the pound sign (#), as those rows would be interpreted as comments and ignored. IDs cannot be empty (i.e. they must consist of at least one character). IDs must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates). At least one ID must be present in the file. IDs cannot use any of the reserved ID column names (the sample ID names, above). The ID column can optionally be followed by additional columns defining metadata associated with each sample or feature ID. Metadata files are not required to have additional metadata columns, so a file containing only an ID column is a valid QIIME 2 metadata file. Column names May consist of any Unicode characters. Cannot be empty (i.e. column names must consist of at least one character). Must be unique (exact string matching is performed to detect duplicates). Column names cannot use any of the reserved ID column names. Column values May consist of any Unicode characters. Empty cells represent missing data. Note that cells consisting solely of whitespace characters are also interpreted as missing data. QIIME 2 currently supports categorical and numeric metadata columns. By default, QIIME 2 will attempt to infer the type of each metadata column: if the column consists only of numbers or missing data, the column is inferred to be numeric. Otherwise, if the column contains any non-numeric values, the column is inferred to be categorical. Missing data (i.e. empty cells) are supported in categorical columns as well as numeric columns. For more details, and for how to define the nature of the data when needed, see the QIIME 2 metadata documentation . Working with an existing metadata file Tip If you have your own metadata file, it will still need to be validated once uploaded to DNA Subway. Using a spreadsheet editor, create a metadata sheet that provides descriptions of the sequencing files used in your experiment. Export this file as a tab-delimited .txt or .tsv file. following the QIIME 2 metadata documentation]( https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/tutorials/metadata/ ) recommendations. (Optional: if you using your own metadata file you can validate it using DNA Subway and or online QIIME2 validator Keemei ). Tip See an example metadata file used for our sample data here: metadata file . Click the Download button on the linked page to download and examine the file. ( Note : This is an Excel version of the metadata file, you must save Excel files as .TSV (tab-separated) to be compatible with the QIIME 2 workflow.)

Note QIIME2 Visualizations One of the features of QIIME 2 are the variety of visualizations provided at several analysis steps. Although this guide will not cover every feature of every visualization, here are some important points to note. QIIME2 View : DNA Subway uses the QIIME 2 View plugin to display visualizations. Like the standalone QIIME 2 software, you can navigate menus, and interact with several visualizations. Importantly, many files and visualizations can be directly download for your use outside of DNA Subway, including in report generation, or in your custom QIIME 2 analyses. You can view downloaded .qza or .qzv files at view.qiime2.org . Quality Graphs Explained After demultiplexing, you will be presented with a visualization that displays the following tables and graphs: Overview Tab Demultiplexed sequence counts summary : For each of the fastq files (each of which may generally correspond to a single sample), you are presented with comparative statistics on the number of sequences present. This is followed by a histogram that plots number of sequences by the number of samples. Per-sample sequence counts : These are the actual counts of sequences per sample as indicated by the sample names you provided in your metadata sheet. Interactive Quality Plot This is an interactive plot that gives you an average quality (y-axis) by the position along the read (x-axis). This box plot is derived from a random sampling of a subset of sequences. The number of sequences sampled will be indicated in the plot caption. You can use your mouse drag and zoom in to regions on the plot. Double-click your mouse to zoom out. 3. Click the \"Interactive Quality Plot\" tab to view a histogram of sequence quality. Use this plot at the tip below to determine a location to trim. Tips on trimming for sequence quality On the Interactive Quality Plot you are shown an histogram, plotting the average quality (x axis) Phred score vs. the position on the read (y axis) in base pairs for a subsample of reads. Zooming to determine 3' trim location Click and drag your mouse around a collection of base pair positions you wish to examine. Clicking on a given histogram bar will also generate a text report and metrics in the table below the chart. Using these metrics, you can choose a position to trim on the right side (e.g. 3' end of the sequence read). The 5' (left trim) is specific to your choice of primers and sequencing adaptors (e.g. the sum of the adaptor sequence you expect to be attached to the 5' end of the read). Poor quality metrics will generate a table colored in red, and those base positions will also be colored red in the histogram. Double-clicking will return the histogram to its original level of zoom. Example plots It is important to maximize the length of the reads while minimizing the use of low quality base calls. To this end, a good guideline is to trim the right end of reads to a length where the 25 th percentile is at a quality score of 25 or more. However, the length of trimming will depend on the quality of the sequence, so you may have to use a lower quality threshold to retain enough sequence for informative sequence searches and alignments. This may require multiple runs of the analysis to find the optimal trim length for your data. Quality drops significantly at base 35 Improved quality sequence C. Use DADA2 for Trimming and Error-correction of Reads It is important to only work with high quality data. This step will generate a sequence quality histogram which can be used to determine parameter for trimming. Click 'DADA2' and choose the metadata file corresponding to the samples you wish to analyze. Then choose values for trimming of the reads. For \"trimLeft\" (the position starting from the left you wish to trim) and \"TruncLen\" (this is the position where reads should be trimmed, truncating the 3' end of the read. Reads shorter than this length will be discarded). Finally, click Trim reads . Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: Based on the histogram for our sample, we recommend the following parameters: trimLeft: 17 (this is specific to primers and adaptors in this experiment) TruncLen: 200 (this is where low quality sequence begins, in this case because our sequence length is lower than the expected read length) D. Check Results of Trimming Once trimming is complete, the following outputs are expected: Click on DADA2 and then click on the links in the Results table to examine results. Trim Table ( Metric summary , Frequency per sample , Frequency per feature ): Summarizes the dataset post-trimming including the number of samples and the number of features per sample. The \"Interactive Sample Detail\" tab contains a sampling depth tool that will be used in computation of the core matrix.

Click each of the following to get access: Alpha Diversity: Pielou's Evenness Alpha Correlation: Measure of community evenness using correlation tests Group Significance: Analysis of differences between features across group Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity Alpha Correlation: Faith Phylogenetic Diversity (a measure of community richness) with correlation tests Group Significance: Faith Phylogenetic Diversity ( a measure of community richness) Beta Diversity: Bray-Curtis Distance Bray-Curtis is a metric for describing the dissimilarity of species in an ecological sampling. - Bioenv: Bray-Curtis test metrics Emperor: Interactive PCoA plot of Bray-Curtis metrics Jaccard Distance Emperor: Interactive PCoA plot calculated by Jaccard similarity index. Unweighted UniFrac Distance UniFrac is a metric for describing the similarity of a biological community, taking into account the relatedness of community members. Bioenv: UniFrac test metrics Emperor: Unweighted interactive PCoA plot Weighted UniFrac Distance Unweighted UniFrac removes the effect of low-abundance features in the calculation of principal components. Emperor: Weighted interactive PCoA plot of UniFrac. Tip Emperor Plots These plots are all interactive three-dimensional plots of an analysis using principal components . Customization You can customize Emperor plots, including altering the color of and shape points, axes, and other parameters. You can also export images from this visualization. Bioenv These plots are tables of tests and descriptive metrics. C. Taxonomic Diversity: Taxonomic diversity is at the heart of many analyses. We suggest consulting the QIIME taxonomy overview for a detailed explanation of how QIIME2 calculates taxonomy and additional features of QIIME2 you may wish to explore beyond the functionalities DNA Subway has included. Bar Plots An interactive stacked bar plot of species diversity. Dropdown menus allow you to color by seven taxonomic levels 1) kingdom, 2) phylum, 3) class, 4) order, 5), family, 6) genus, 7) species. Plots can be further arranged/filtered/sorted accoridng to characteristics in the sample metadata. You may also download images and data used to create the barpot visualization. Taxonomy A table indicating the identified \"features\", their taxa, and an indication of confidence. You can download and interact with any of the available plots. D. Calculate differential abundance Click on the 'Differential abundance' stop. Then click on the \"Submit new \"Differential abundance\" job\" link. Choose a metadata category to group by, and a level of taxonomy to summarize by. Then click &submit job {.interpreted-text role=\"guilabel\"}. Sample Data \"ubiome-test-data\" dataset: We recommend the following parameters: Group data by : CollectionMethod Level of taxonomy to summarize : 5 Tip Download the provided CSV files so that you can generate customized plots.","title":"DNA Subway Purple Line - Calculate Core Metrics/Alpha and Beta Diversity"},{"location":"step8/#dna-subway-purple-line-visualize-data-with-picrust-and-phyloseq","text":"Under Development Fix or improve this documentation Search for an answer: CyVerse Learning Center Ask us for help: click the Intercom icon on the lower right-hand side of the page Report an issue or submit a change: Github Repo Send feedback: learning@CyVerse.org","title":"DNA Subway Purple Line - Visualize data with PiCrust and PhyloSeq"}]}
